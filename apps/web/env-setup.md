# Environment Variables Setup

âœ… **COMPLETED**: A `.env.local` file has been created in the `apps/web` directory with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:43219
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoibW90YXNlbTk4IiwiYSI6ImNtY2FsOTF4dDA0YjEycnI5MWk0dWhmanEifQ.sCrxzxaF0a7HmQAMdfUzDg
```

The hardcoded environment variables have been removed from `next.config.ts` and moved to the `.env.local` file for better security and configuration management.

## Environment Variables Reference

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend API URL (currently set to localhost:43219)
